# vaultlet — outstanding work

Status as of 2026-09-01 (`89b0bdc`). `GetSecret`,
`ListSecrets` and `DeleteSecret` are implemented and verified end to end against
Bitwarden; `PutSecret` is implemented but untested against a write-enabled token.

Ordered roughly by impact. The suggested sequence is at the bottom.

---

## 1. Functional gaps

### 1.1 WatchSecrets is unimplemented

- [ ] Not started.

The largest remaining piece. The proto declares the RPC and the CLI already has
a complete client for it — `internal/adapters/driving/cli/watch.go` handles the
initial snapshot, `IN_SYNC`, event rendering in both text and JSON, and Ctrl-C —
but the server answers `Unimplemented` via the embedded
`UnimplementedSecretServiceServer`.

What it needs:

- A watch method on `ports.SecretStore`. The port has no streaming surface today.
- A polling implementation in the Bitwarden adapter. Bitwarden exposes no change
  feed, so the loop diffs successive `List` calls and emits ADDED / UPDATED /
  DELETED from the difference. `bitwarden.Config.PollInterval` (`poll_interval:
  30s` in `vaultlet.yaml`) is parsed for exactly this and currently unused.
- Per the proto: emit one ADDED per existing secret, then exactly one `IN_SYNC`,
  then live changes. Metadata only — never values.

Note that `versionAt` derives the version from `RevisionDate`, so an UPDATED
event is detectable as a version change on an unchanged key.

### 1.2 Compare-and-swap

- [x] `DeleteSecret` now rejects `expected_version` with `Unimplemented`,
      matching `PutSecret` (`ad85107`). The two RPCs are consistent and no
      longer mislead callers.
- [ ] Real compare-and-swap is still unimplemented.

Real CAS needs an `expectedVersion` parameter on `SecretStore.Put` and
`.Delete`, plus `ports.ErrVersionMismatch` mapped to `ABORTED`. Bitwarden has no
native CAS, so it would be a read-compare-write with a race window — which is
worth saying out loud in the adapter rather than pretending otherwise. Until
then `--expected-version` on the CLI is a flag that can only ever fail; consider
hiding it.

### 1.3 No TLS on the server

- [x] Done (`89b0bdc`). `config.TLSConfig` (`tls.cert_file` / `tls.key_file`
      in `vaultlet.yaml`) feeds `grpcserver.New(store, cfg.TLS)`, which builds
      the server with `grpc.Creds(...)` via `credentials.NewServerTLSFromFile`.
      TLS is mandatory — there is no plaintext mode — and `Validate()` rejects
      missing cert/key paths with clear messages before startup.
- [x] Verified live: booted with the self-signed dev cert in `cert/`
      (gitignored), `openssl s_client -CAfile cert/cert.pem` handshakes
      TLSv1.3 with verify code 0, and SIGTERM still drains cleanly through
      the new code path.

Remaining nit, optional: `NewServerTLSFromFile` leaves the server's floor at
Go's default TLS 1.2; the client pins 1.3. Switching to `tls.LoadX509KeyPair`
+ `credentials.NewTLS(&tls.Config{MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS13, ...})` would
state the same policy on both halves.

### 1.4 No authentication, authorization or audit

- [ ] Not started.

The proto commits to `PERMISSION_DENIED` and "the principal's policy", and the
`GetSecret` comment calls it "the one place where a per-read policy check and
audit record have to happen". None of it exists: no interceptor, no principal,
no policy, no audit record.

Related: `internal/app/` is an empty directory. The gRPC handlers call
`ports.SecretStore` directly, which is fine for a pure passthrough but leaves
nowhere for policy and audit to live. This layer is the natural home for both.

### 1.5 Read-only backends (`ports.ErrReadOnly`)

- [x] Done (`02eac5a`). `ports.ErrReadOnly` is declared alongside `ErrNotFound`
      and wrapped by the adapter as `fmt.Errorf("bitwarden: %w", ...)`, so
      `errors.Is` works across the port boundary.
- [x] `bitwarden.Config.AllowWrites` (`allow_writes` in `vaultlet.yaml`) gates
      both writes: `Put` and `Delete` return `ErrReadOnly`, `Get` and `List`
      are unaffected.
- [x] `PutSecret` and `DeleteSecret` map it to `FAILED_PRECONDITION` with a
      fixed "backend is read-only" message, ahead of the `ErrNotFound` and
      `ErrEmptyValue` branches so it cannot be shadowed. The backend name is not
      leaked to clients, per the proto's design note.

Open question, not a defect: `vaultlet.yaml` ships `allow_writes: true`, so the
zero value is permissive. Deny-by-default would fail safe for a service the
proto describes as "read-mostly". Worth deciding deliberately.

## 2. Bugs

### 2.1 `make build` does not stamp the version

- [x] Fixed. `CLI_PKG` now points at `internal/adapters/driving/cli`
      (`3f73bf3`); `make build && ./bin/vaultlet-cli version` reports
      `vaultlet 6b8fd65 (commit 6b8fd65, built 2026-08-31T19:03:52Z)`.
      The `root.go` doc comment was corrected too.
- [x] The last stale path in `cmd/vaultlet-cli/main.go:3` was corrected
      (`49c8a54`). No `internal/adapters/cli` references remain.

### 2.2 `config.Load` discards both load errors

- [x] Fixed (`6b8fd65`). Both `k.Load` calls are now checked, with
      `errors.Is(err, fs.ErrNotExist)` tolerating a missing `vaultlet.yaml` or
      `.env`, and the env-provider error propagated.
- [x] `Config.Validate()` was added and is called from `cmd/vaultlet/main.go`
      before the backend is opened. It covers `Backend` and `Listen`.

### 2.3 The server cannot shut down cleanly

- [x] `server.go` moved off `log` onto `slog`.
- [x] Graceful shutdown implemented (`d096586`). `run()` builds a
      signal-aware context via `signal.NotifyContext` (SIGINT/SIGTERM);
      `Listen` runs `Serve` in a goroutine and selects on `ctx.Done()`, then
      drains via `GracefulStop` bounded by a 10s `shutdownTimeout` with a
      forced `Stop()` fallback.
- [x] The nil-listener regression is fixed in the same change: `Listen`
      returns an `error` for both `net.Listen` and `Serve` failures, and
      `run()` propagates it.
- [x] Bonus fix found along the way: the `store.(interface{ Close() error })`
      assertion in `main.go` never matched the Bitwarden store's `Close()`
      (no error return), so the FFI handle leaked on every exit. Now asserts
      `interface{ Close() }`.

### 2.4 `domain.Namespace.Matches` is an unfinished stub

- [x] Resolved (`6b8fd65`) by dropping the dangling comment. `key.go` now ends
      cleanly at `Contains`. Glob matching remains unimplemented, which is fine
      — nothing depends on it.

### 2.5 Per-RPC invocation logging

- [x] The copy-paste slip introduced in `e5d8406` is fixed (`49c8a54`): each
      handler now names its own RPC rather than all four claiming `GetSecret`.
- [ ] The logging itself is still thin. Three improvements remain:

- Use `slog.InfoContext(ctx, ...)` to match the `ErrorContext` calls below them.
- Include the key or namespace as an attribute; a bare "invoked" line carries no
  information a request counter would not.
- Consider a `grpc.UnaryInterceptor` instead. One interceptor logs method,
  duration and resulting status code for every RPC, cannot drift per handler,
  and is where the audit record from §1.4 will want to live anyway.

---

## 3. Missing scaffolding

### 3.1 No tests

- [ ] Not started. Still no `_test.go` anywhere in the repo, though `make test`
      exists.

- `domain`: `ParseKey`, `ParseNamespace`, `Namespace.Contains` are pure
  functions against a documented grammar. Cheapest, highest-value tests here.
- `grpcserver`: the handlers are testable against a fake `ports.SecretStore` —
  particularly the error mapping (`ErrNotFound` → `NOT_FOUND`, `ErrEmptyValue` →
  `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, empty namespace → list everything, non-empty page token →
  rejected, `expected_version` → `UNIMPLEMENTED` on both put and delete).
- `cli`: `NewRootCmd` returns a `*cobra.Command` specifically so "tests can
  execute commands with their own args and output buffers" — a seam nothing
  currently uses.

### 3.2 Pagination is server-side unimplemented

- [ ] Not started.

`ListSecrets` ignores `page_size` and always returns one page. This is legal per
the proto ("server may return fewer than requested") and the CLI already loops
on `next_page_token`, so it can wait — but it will matter on a large org.

### 3.3 Second backend

- [ ] Not started.

`internal/adapters/driven/aws/` is an empty directory. A second backend is the
whole point of the ports design and the best proof the abstraction holds.

---

## 4. Smaller items

- [ ] `list.go` uses `cobra.ExactArgs(1)`, so the CLI cannot reach the
      empty-namespace "list everything" the server now supports.
      `cobra.MaximumNArgs(1)` opens it up.
- [ ] `resolveID` lists the entire organization on every Get, Put and Delete.
      The comment acknowledges the cost; it will bite once the vault is
      non-trivial. A short-lived name→UUID cache is the obvious mitigation.
- [ ] A permissions gap and a genuinely absent secret are indistinguishable to
      the caller — both surface as `NOT_FOUND`. An org listing that returns zero
      rows overall is far more likely to be a misconfigured machine account than
      an empty vault, and is worth logging as such in `resolveID`. (Confirmed in
      practice: a machine account with no project access reads as an empty org.)
- [x] `ListSecretsResponse{..., NextPageToken: ""}` — the explicit zero value
      was dropped (`49c8a54`).
- [x] Stray blank lines before a closing brace in the read-only guards
      (`handlers.go` `DeleteSecret`, `bitwarden.go` `Delete`) — removed
      (uncommitted). All three sites are now clean.

---

## Suggested order

1. Domain and handler tests, before the surface grows further. The read-only
   mapping is a good first case: it is pure error translation.
2. `WatchSecrets`, including the port change and the Bitwarden polling loop.
3. The policy/audit layer in `internal/app` — where the logging in §2.5
   should end up as an interceptor.
